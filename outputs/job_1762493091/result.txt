You're super close—the image looks good, but Tesseract needs a clean, high-contrast, correctly scaled, black-text-on-white image. Let's tweak the pipeline so we give Tesseract exactly that, try a few OCR settings, and automatically pick the best result. What we'll change (quick summary) 1. Create a separate OCR-ready image (pure binary, upscaled, black text on white). 2. Try multiple PSM/OEM combos and pick the one with the highest confidence. 3. Keep your current “Enhanced” image only for display; use the new ocr.png for Tesseract.
